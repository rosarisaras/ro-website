        <p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed text-lg typewriter">Rosari was named after the Hindu goddess Sarasvati, who is known as the goddess of learning and the arts. As a result, she spent a lot of her time studying and making art.</p>
        
        <p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed text-lg">In 2022, she graduated from NYU Steinhardt with an MA in Teaching Dance in the Professions: American Ballet Theatre (ABT) Pedagogy. She is an ABTÂ® Certified Teacher and was a class assistant at the ABT Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis School. Additionally, she completed a dance teacher training program at the Mark Morris Dance Center in 2020 and received a Pilates certification through the Club Pilates Teacher Training Program in 2023. From 2020 to 2022, she studied American Modern Dance and Graham Technique at the Martha Graham Dance School. Before working in dance full-time, she was a lawyer and received her law degree from Universitas Pelita Harapan in 2018 and the University of Georgia in 2019.</p>
        
        <p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed text-lg">Rosari is passionate about teaching the next generation of leaders in the dance industry. As a dance educator, she is determined to provide well-rounded knowledge that allows one to be a versatile and healthy dancer, both mentally and physically. She strives to foster creative and critical thinking by encouraging meaningful discussion and collaborative work in the classroom. She also aspires to nurture unique individual artistic expression and help students hone their skills. Most importantly, she aims to bring the joy of movement into the process by creating developmentally age-appropriate classes.</p>
        
        <p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed text-lg">Rosari has taught ballet, contemporary, and modern dance through an Indonesian diaspora lens at various places such as ABT Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis School, Mark Morris Dance Center, NYU Kaleidoscope, Notes in Motion, and Menari Dance Academy. She is currently pioneering the Great Plains and works full-time as a Children's Division Coordinator at Northern Plains Dance in North Dakota. In that capacity, she actively creates original works and choreographs for numerous Northern Plains Dance Productions.</p>
